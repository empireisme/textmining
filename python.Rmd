## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(reticulate)
conda_create("emajor")
```

```{r}
library(reticulate)
use_python("C:\\Users\\Administrator\\AppData\\Local\\r-miniconda\\envs\\emajor\\python.exe", required = T)
use_condaenv("emajor")
```

```{python}

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
x=np.zeros(10)

x

```
